Created an application that allows the user to input data about an employee, which upon submission will add data to a table. The total monthly cost will be calculated below the table and recalculated for each employee that is added. If total montly cost exceeds $20,000, the total monthly cost will turn red to alert the user. Users are also able to delete employees from the table and the total will again be recalulated.

I chose to break up the logic into a few different functions so it would be easier to see what each function is doing. So instead of writing one giant function, I wrote a few smaller functions and just called those functions upon submission of the form. I think this made it easier for me to keep track of my progress as I completed the application.
